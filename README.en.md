# Polish IT Matura exam

I chose to mostly use the English language despite regretting making the mistake of using the Polish language on GitHub, because this is mainly a Polish topic targeted for young adults about to take the [Matura exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matura) - secondary school exit exam or "maturity diploma". Matura is a matriculation examination and can be compared to A-Level exams or Abitur<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matura)</sup>.

I've also used Polish comments (but I use English variable names out of habit sometimes so nothing's a rule here), so if you want to check this repo out go ahead, the code is not complicated. The problem is you have just 3 hours to write all this. Which is a bummer, unless you want to use Microsoft Office... :sweat_smile:
